// JavaScript Execution Context
// When JavaScript code runs, it does so in a specific context that determines
// how variables and functions are accessed and executed.


// There are three types of execution contexts:

// 1.Global Execution Context: This is the default context where the code starts executing. 
// It includes everything thatâ€™s not inside a function.

// 2.Function Execution Context: Each time a function is called,
// a new execution context is created for that function.

// 3.Eval Execution Context: This is created when code is executed inside an eval function.
// Phases of Execution


// JavaScript executes in two main phases:

// 1.Memory Creation Phase (Hoisting):

// * Before any code runs, 
// JavaScript scans through the code and allocates memory for variables and functions.
//  * Variables are set to undefined, 
//  and function declarations are stored in memory with their actual definitions.


//2.Execution Phase:

// In this phase, the code is executed line by line.
// Variables get assigned their values.
// Functions are called and executed.


// Summary

// Execution Contexts: JavaScript runs in different contexts (global, function, eval).

// Two Phases:

// Memory Creation: Sets up the variables and functions.

// Execution: Runs the code and performs operations.
